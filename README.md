Welcome to the project page for Zafir's independent study on artificial intelligence and machine learning! 

This project started as an "independent study project" for school, going from November 2022 to April 2023, but I plan on continuing my study after the deadline.

This site is made using the [Jekyll Gitbook theme](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook).
The cover for this page is Camille Pissaro's *Morning, An Overcast Day, Rouen*.
